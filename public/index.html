			<h3>Repurpose is an online marketplace that connects businesses with excess supplies to underfunded public schools. Our mission is to be the most convenient and trusted source for free and high quality used goods and professional services. Available to public and charter schools exclusively, supplies will be posted where schools can browse and claim the ones they need. A portion of each business subscription fee will be given to the local school of its choice, providing teachers and administrators a way to purchase unavailable but essential materials that millions of children depend on.</h3>
